# NeuralNetworkDeepLearning
Final project for the exam of Neural Network &amp; Deep-Learning from Prof. Jacopo Pegoraro (A.A. 202/2023).

Such a project has the aim of testing different NN architectures, namely ORION and RotatioNet, in order to build a 3D model classifier.
The NNs are trained and then tested on ModelNet10 and ModelNet40. Data preparation has been really important for improving performances.
